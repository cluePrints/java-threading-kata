# java-threading-kata
A set of practical tasks to grasp multithreading concepts better (mostly inspired by bugs I've seen)

The idea is to make all the unit tests green while by one and learn new concepts gradually.

## General rules
1. You don't change unit tests ever during your practice (feel free to contribute fixes back via pull requests though)
2. You fix tests one by one
3. Hints are available for each test encoded in base64 so https://www.base64decode.org/ to decode them
4. Exercise numbers currently only represent the creation order :)
5. Final methods are not meant for change

Recommended order:

* 000 - Configuring thread names
* 001 - Scheduling thread to run concurrently
